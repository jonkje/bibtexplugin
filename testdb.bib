  abstract = {Heterogeneous integration of III-V compound semiconductors on Silicon
	on Insulator is one the key technology for next-generation on-chip
	optical interconnects. In this context, the use of photonic crystals
	lasers represents a disruptive solution in terms of footprint, activation
	energy and ultrafast response. In this work, we propose and fabricate
	very compact laser sources integrated with a passive silicon waveguide
	circuitry. Using a subjacent Silicon-On-Insulator waveguide, the
	emitted light from a photonic crystal based cavity laser is efficiently
	captured. We study experimentally the evanescent wave coupling responsible
	for the funneling of the emitted light into the silicon waveguide
	mode as a function of the hybrid structure parameters, showing that
	90\% of coupling efficiency is possible.},

  abstract = {Photonic crystal nanocavities are expected to make great contributionsin
	areas of physics and engineering such as the slowing and stopping
	of lightand optical quantum information processing. We first review
	approaches tothe goal of increasing the quality factor of two-dimensional
	photonic crystalnanocavities. Losses from a cavity can be suppressed,
	with a consequent increaseof the quality factor, by containing the
	electromagnetic field in the formof a Gaussian envelope function.
	We then propose a new method of analyticalcavity design, based on
	the detailed investigation of waveguide modes, inorder to realize
	Gaussian cavity mode fields. This has enabled us to achievea quality
	factor of \$\{\{\{\textblackslash\}sim\}10^\{9\}\}\$ while maintaining
	a cavity volume of one cubic wavelength.},

	in photonic crystal H1-defect nanocavity on the slab thickness and
	observe an increase of Q even after closing of the photonic bandgap
	both in numerical simulation and experimentation. This counter intuitive

	by computing the overlap between them in the momentum space.},
